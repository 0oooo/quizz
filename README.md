# LE QUIZZ DU PUB DU LUNDI 

No. 

Project to build a python app (unsure yet of frontend) to quizz common dev interview questions. 

## Prerequisites

### Python

[Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

### A virtual environment

Create a virtual environment in a desired directory

For example
``cd sys32
python3 -m venv myvirtualenvironmentwithalongname``

To be honest, I'm not fully full on with virtual environment, my own app is confusing with a quizzenv, a quizz parent folder, a quizz python project with its own quizz subdirectory, and the quizzapp app... I mean.. That's pretty ugly. But let's roll with it

Also, about virtual environment, if you like to read it's [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) or if you prefer to [listen](https://realpython.com/lessons/what-virtual-environments-are-good-for/)

## Let's go gurls!

### Set up the database 

Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create migrations and prepare the database for it. 

Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply those changes to the database.

Honestly, what is dat? Don't hesitate to share your thoughts cause I don't understand and I am tempted to just create an alias to do them both with one word

Just having to type python manage.py everytime I want to do something...... what am I, a writer?
